Brief description
-----------------
TouchEffect is an engineering tool to profile User Experience of touch. It can generate FPS and Latency when gesture playing on touch-supported UI, which can then be used to analyze the smoothness and responsiveness of the UI behaves.

TouchEffect is a tool composed by two parts: gesture simulator and effect sampler. Gesture simulator, as named, can play gestures like SWIPE, PINCH, etc. automatically. There are two simulators in TouchEffect: gestureSim and eventHunter. gestureSim works based on X extension - XTest, as X extension does not support multi-touch protocol yet, gestureSim can only simulate single-point gestures. eventHunter works based on linux input interface, it simulates both single and multi gestures under the multi-touch protocol. At effect sampler part, effectHunter is just the utility for this. It uses another X extension - XDamage to get the statitics, which can then be used as the refresh rate of the target widget, and also the latency of the first movement.

How to build this tool
----------------------
Get into the folder and type 'make'

TouchEffect uses C++, thus g++ and libstdc++ are needed. And each of its utilities requirs different libraries:
* gestureSim
libxdamage-dev
libxtst-dev

* eventHunter
no specific ones

* effectHunter 
libxdamage-dev
libxtst-dev

And effectHunter also uses pthread library


How to play with this tool
--------------------------
TouchEffect can be played with its perl shell, while each of its utilities can also be executed seperately.
* Sample smoothness (FPS) during SWIPING on a browser page
Firstly open the target web page with browser and make sure the content is long enough to be scrolled, and scroll the page to the middle position to make sure it can be scrolled freely.
Then use 'xwininfo' to get the widget id of the browser window.
And start TouchEffect with cmd below: perl ./touchEffect
